## Requires: 

julia (>=4.5), cdo (>=1.5)

*Julia packages*: Interpolations, ArgParse, NetCDF

## Installation

You will need an implementation of the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/) on your machine. 

Launch julia and from the REPL do

    Pkg.clone("https://github.com/jhardenberg/RainFARM.jl")

where `username` is your username. This will install the package. 
Assuming your julia is v0.5, in `~/.julia/v0.5/rainfarm/tools` you will find the command line tools. Copy/link these to somewhere in your path in order to use them.

- test from the julia REPL calling `using RainFARM`

In the `tools` subdirectory you will find the command line tools. Link or copy these to somewhere in you path in order to use them.
