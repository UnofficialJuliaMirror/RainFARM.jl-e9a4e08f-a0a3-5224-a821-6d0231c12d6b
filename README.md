##Requires: 
julia (>=4.5), cdo (>=1.5)

*Julia packages*: Interpolations, ArgParse, NetCDF

## Installation

### Method 1 (If you have access to the bitbucket repo)

Launch julia and from the REPL do

    Pkg.clone("https://bitbucket.org/jhard/rainfarm.jl")

where `username` is your username. This will install the package. 
Assuming your julia is v0.5, in `~/.julia/v0.5/rainfarm/tools` you will find the command line tools. Copy/link these to somewhere in your path in order to use them.

### Method 2 (If you received a tarball)

- Install the content of this package in a directory, e.g. `/opt/julia/RainFARM`
- Add the `src` subdirectory to the julia search path by adding the following line to `.juliarc` in your home directory:

```
    push!(LOAD_PATH, "/opt/julia/RainFARM/src")
```

- launch julia and do:

``` 
    Pkg.add("Interpolations")
    Pkg.add("AggParse")
    Pkg.add("NetCDF") 
```

- test from the julia REPL calling `using RainFARM`

In the `tools` subdirectory you will find the command line tools. Link or copy these to somewhere in you path in order to use them.
